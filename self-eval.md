# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? It was challenging but ultimately satisfying.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? I am taking more breaks then I thought I would. That is not a bad thing however.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I want to remember the vocabulary.
